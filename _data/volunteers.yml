  subtitle: We provide free services to in-need communities
  text: Tech companies control almost every part of our daily life, from how we communicate to where we travel and, even, how we buy our groceries. Diversity isn't just important for the tech itselfâ€”-it's important for the people who make and use technology.

  subtitle: There's no better time than now to volunteer
  text: Whether you want to make a difference in your community, inspire the next generation or simply help where help is needed, our volunteers and corporate partners are as diverse as the students we help.
