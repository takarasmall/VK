title: Computer programming lessons are critical for future success

description:
  - We believe technology has the power to uplift entire communities and allow job creators in underserved neighbourhoods the chance to relize their true potential. Meanwhile, these days most good-paying, middle-class jobs that were once available to youth who couldn't afford college or university credentials are slowly disappearing and being replaced with jobs that require post-secondary education. Computer programming is the one bright spot where jobs and opportunities still exist for those eager to learn digital skills.
  - Canada is one of the world's top technology hubs. Local talent will be needed to fuel future growth--especially in light the country's ongoing talent shortage--and therefore training employable youth from across the country is the best way to do that in order to support the country's growing economy.
